# Eulerian Video Magnification for Subtle Motion Detection

This repository provides an implementation of the **Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM)** algorithm, which enhances subtle motion and color variations in videos. The technique enables the visualization of physiological signalsâ€”such as heartbeats, breathing, and skin color changesâ€”that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on building a computational pipeline for amplifying subtle temporal changes in videos using spatial decomposition and temporal bandpass filtering.

### Real-world Applications:
- Non-invasive physiological monitoring  
- Biomedical signal enhancement  
- Human-computer interaction  
- Behavioral and psychological analysis  
- Surveillance and anomaly detection

##  Key Features

- Spatial decomposition using Laplacian pyramids  
- Temporal filtering using Butterworth filters  
- Motion and color signal amplification  
- Real-time rendering of enhanced videos  
- Tested on facial video datasets with visible physiological cues
